# ðŸŽ’ local.ai

A desktop app for local, private, secured AI experimentation. Included out-of-the box are:
- A known-good model API and a model downloader, with descriptions such as recommended hardware specs, model license, blake3/sha256 hashes etc...
- A simple note-taking app, with inference config PER note. The note and its config are output into plain text `.mdx` format
- A model inference streaming server (/completion endpoint, similar to OpenAI)

It's made to be used alongside https://github.com/alexanderatallah/window.ai/ as a simple way to have a local inference server up and running in no time. window.ai + local.ai enable every web app to utilize AI without incurring any cost from either the developer or the user!

Right now, local.ai uses the https://github.com/rustformers/llm rust crate at its core. Check them out, they are super cool!

## ðŸ¤” Trivia

### Why the backpack?

> Ties into the bring your own model concept -- Alex from window.ai

### Why GPLv3?

Anything AI-related including their derivatives should be open-source for all to inspect. GPLv3 enforces this chain of open-source.

### The naming seems close to [LocalAI](https://github.com/go-skynet/LocalAI)?

- When I first started the project and got the domain localai.app, I had no idea LocalAI was a thing. A friend of mine forwarded me a link to that project mid May, and I was like dang it, let's just add a dot and call it a day (for now...) - local "dot" ai vs LocalAI lol
- We might [rename the project](https://github.com/louisgv/local.ai/discussions/71).
